# Build a Simple Web App using Go

Hello everyone, Today I would like to discuss building a simple hello world web app with Golang. Go is already has a web server built-in. The "net/http" package from the standard library contains all the things we need to do with the HTTP protocol. In this example, we will see how easy it is to run a web server that we can see in our browser.

For creating a webserver in go, we need to understand two main functions.

# Request Handler
  As the name suggests, the Request Handler is the one which receives all the http connections from the browser. The syntax of the Request Handler function is 
  
  ```func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)```

  The handler function receives two arguments:

  1. http.Request - contains all details about the HTTP request including things like the URL, header or body fields.

  2. http.ResponseWriter - where we write out a response to.

  So first, we need to register a Handler function. 

# Request Listener
The Request Handler function can only receive the http connections. Along with that, we need a Request Listener which listens on a port and passes the connection to the Handler function. 

The syntax of a listner function is

```http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)```

The listener function receives two arguments:
1. port - The port to listen for the http connections.
2. handler - the handler to send all the connection. Typically the handler is nil.

# Hello World Web App
By understanding the above function, it is simple to create a web server. The code for a simple hello world web server looks like this

```
// main.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)
func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")	
  })
  http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)
}
```

Run the main.go using the command ```go run main.go```

So, if we now go to the browser and open http://localhost:3000/ we can see the "Hello, World!" text which we are returning.

In this example, the handler function is mapper to the root path which is "/". Likewise, we can create multiple routes and register them to their corresponding handlers.

All done! ðŸŽ‰

Thatâ€™s it for now guys. Will meet you guys again with another interesting topic.
